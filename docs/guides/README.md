# Introduction

The Underscore Protocol (**\_Prtcl**) includes a set of tools for building interoperable content-management applications compatible with Web3 platforms and Web2-APIs.

It combines some of the concepts of The Web and Linked Data, promoting the use of global identifiers for every object handled by a web application, with the data structure of GIT, where each object evolves as a sequence of snapshots (commits).

Objects from \_prtcl-compatible applications are suitable to be:

- _referenced_ from any other application and platform, using URL-like global identifiers extended to include emerging web3 platforms.

- _rendered and updated_ on any other application, with reusable web-components and data type recognition.

- _forked_ by creating new branches of the same object on different platforms and by different authors.

## Client

\_Prtcl client libraries can be used to create and update \_Prtcl objects on one ore more platforms from the same application. The libraries include multi-layer mutation buffering, data fetching cache, and event-based reactivity for efficiently reading and updating data.

## Remotes

\_Prtcl remotes are servers or connectors to Web3 networks that can store and update \_Prtcl content. Similar to a web-server, they resolve object's unique ids into their current content.

For Web2 applications \_Prtcl offers a NodeJS + DGraph headless CMS that can be deployed inhouse, or consumed directly from the cloud.

For Web3 applications \_Prtcl offers connectors with Ethereum, Polkadot, Holochain and OrbitDB networks. These services can be paired with our web-server CMS to offer, indexing, discovery and performant data fetching.

## Modules and UI Components

\_Prtcl is building Intercreativity, a web-application that is similar to recent applications like Notion or Roam Research, but that is \_prtcl-compatible. Intercreativity is extensible and modules and UI components from Intercreativity, such as it's block-based text editor, are built to be reusable on other content-management applications.
