# Introduction

The Underscore Protocol (**\_Prtcl**) provides a simple set of rules for building interoperable content-management applications compatible with Web2-APIs and emerging Web3 platforms.

It combines some of the concepts of The Web, promoting the use of global identifiers with the data structure of GIT, where each objects evolves as a sequence of chained hashed commit versions.

Content from \_prtcl-compatible applications is suitable to be:

- _referenced_ from any other application. This uses URL-like global identifiers for mutable references that include emerging web3 platforms.

- _rendered_ on any other application. This is done with reusable web-components and dynamic object-type transformations.

- _forked_ by creating new branches, as new tips of the sequence of commits of the object that share a common ancestor.

- _interacted with_ from other applications. This is done by defining a limited set of basic primitives common to all content-management applications: namely _update_, _link_, _nest_ and _fork_.

## Storage Providers (Remotes)

\_Prtcl also provides ready-to-use solutions for storing content on different platforms.

For Web2 applications we offer a NodeJS + DGraph headless CMS that can be deployed inhouse, or consumed directly from the cloud.

For Web3 applications we offer connectors with Ethereum, Polkadot, Holochain and OrbitDB networks. These services can be paired with our web-server CMS to offer, indexing, discovery and performant data fetching.

## Modules and UI Components

\_Prtcl is building Intercreativity, a web-application that is similar to recent applications like Notion or Roam Research, but that is \_prtcl-compatible. Intercreativity is extensible and modules and UI components from Intercreativity are build to be reusable on other content-management applications.
